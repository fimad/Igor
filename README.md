Senior Project
==============

All of the files related to my senior project. The paper/ directory contains the draft of my final paper. The src/ directory contains the implementation of a gadget-based metamorphic engine inspired by return-oriented programming techniques and the Frankenstein metamorphic system [1].

The engine is written in Haskell and contains fairly decent Haddock documentation throughout.
