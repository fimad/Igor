      Presents theoretical foundations rooted in compiler theory for generating multiple semantically equivalent variations of a program. 
      Theoretically, a functional polymorphic engine parses a set of abstract ``behaviours'' and given a predefined attribute grammar, non-deterministically expands the behaviours into concrete operations.
      The prototype implementation is fairly limited, defining 4 behaviours, and a set of handwritten assembly building blocks corresponding to each behaviour.
      \par
      This paper suggests the relevance of non-deterministic compilers to the generation of metamorphic and polymorphic code.

      Presents a new method of binary obfuscation, mimimorphism, that can thwart both static and dynamic analysis.
      The process involves altering statistical properties of the target binary to match those of a benign program.
      The result is a malicious program that has benign appearing opcode frequencies and sequences, that also exhibits known benign syscall traces.
      \par
      The techniques employed in the paper for preserving the semantic properties of the target program while incorporating statistical properties of benign programs may prove useful in the automatic generation of semantically equivalent building blocks for use in functional polymorphic engines.

      A formal proof showing that classifying metamorphic variants of a virus is NP-complete.

      This proof motivates the study of metamorphic variants and may provide guidance as to the type of transformations that result in NP-completeness.

      Presents a method of control flow obfuscation by flattening the basic block graph flow graph.
      The method involves replacing direct branching between basic blocks with data-dependent branches through the use of a dispatching switch statement.
      The authors also show that the analysis of such an obfuscated program is NP-hard.

      The dispatcher based control flow shown in this paper along with being difficult to analyze may provide a flexible framework for building more complex metamorphic control flow transformations.

      The paper describes mimicry attacks which can be used to bypass detection by anomaly based intrusion detection systems.

      This paper presents an early foundation for work in \cite{mimimorph} and suggests that the noise provided by ``no-op'' syscalls may be sufficient in evading syscall based detection systems.
