      Presents theoretical foundations rooted in compiler theory for generating multiple semantically equivalent variations of a program. 
      Theoretically, a functional polymorphic engine parses a set of abstract ``behaviours'' and given a predefined attribute grammar, non-deterministically expands the behaviours into concrete operations.
      The prototype implementation is fairly limited, defining 4 behaviours, and a set of handwritten assembly building blocks corresponding to each behaviour.
      \par
      This paper suggests the relevance of non-deterministic compilers to the generation of metamorphic and polymorphic code.

      Presents a new method of binary obfuscation, mimimorphism, that can thwart both static and dynamic analysis.
      The process involves altering statistical properties of the target binary to match those of a benign program.
      The result is a malicious program that has benign appearing opcode frequencies and sequences, that also exhibits known benign syscall traces.

      The techniques employed in the paper for preserving the semantic properties of the target program while incorporating statistical properties of benign programs may prove useful in the automatic generation of semantically equivalent building blocks for use in functional polymorphic engines.

      This paper borrows ideas from recent advances in return-oriented programming and applies them to metamorphism whereby new variants of a program are created by harvesting gadgets from known benign files.
      The resulting binaries are therefore unlikely to contain any opcode sequences that would result in detection by static analysis.
