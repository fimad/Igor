% The line below is sufficient. Always use ``finalcopy'' for annotated
% bibliographies. They look funny when they are double-spaced. See the
% sample document for other options that can appear between the
% brackets.

%
% The one package you definitely need is url. You may use the same
% format to add others.

\usepackage{url}

%
% Fill in the parts between the braces. You will not be able to process
% your document until (at least some of) the items are present.
%
% Format for date: Month dd, yyyy
%
% Adviser and acknowledgment are not needed here. An abstract is
% probably unnecessary as well.
