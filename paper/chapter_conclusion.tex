\chapter{Conclusion}

    Commercial antivirus software has historically relied on static techniques
    to detect instances of malware in the wild. Typical implementations rely on
    byte signatures to detect malicious programs. An active area of research is
    creating robust detection techniques which are able to cope with metamorphic
    malware which is capable of obfuscating it's byte signature. An emerging
    static technique that has shown academic success is using knowledge of the
    structure of benign programs to classify malware, a prominent example of
    this being opcode frequency analysis \cite{chisquared}.

    The metamorphic system presented in this paper is shown to be capable of
    producing programs that exhibit a high degree of variation in their
    byte signatures while at the same time maintaining an opcode-frequency
    distribution similar to those found in benign Windows programs. It performs
    well compared to state of the art gadget-based metamorphic engines in terms
    of byte signature variance and out performs the state of the art in respect
    to conforming to benign opcode distributions.

    Further, this paper has also provided empirical support for the claim made
    in \cite{franken} that suggest that when nondeterministically stitching
    together a program out of gadgets, the resulting program's overall opcode
    distribution can be controlled by altering the distribution that the gadgets
    are sampled from.

    By achieving high levels byte signature variance and opcode frequency
    conformity the described engine demonstrates that it is currently feasible
    for malware authors to evade both the current algorithms and emerging static
    detection techniques. Given the high degree of obfuscation that state of the
    art metamorphic systems are able to produce, antivirus software must move
    from a statically oriented approach to one that incorporates behavioural
    analysis as well if vendors wish to keep up with evolving metamorphic
    techniques.

    \section{Future Work}

    The system described is a proof of concept and as such contains many areas
    that would benefit from further research.

    \subsection{Improvements In Modelling Benign Programs}

    The byte source proposed by this paper uses a 1-gram byte model to describe
    byte distributions and is a trivial improvement over the naive approach of
    sampling gadgets from a uniform distribution. It would be useful to examine
    the performance of the engine under more complicated models such as general
    n-gram models, and models based on opcodes frequencies instead of byte
    frequencies.

    There is also the potential of incorporating the model into the code
    generation algorithm by choosing gadgets based on their probability instead
    of uniformly choosing them currently.

    \subsection{Code Generation}

    There are several pruning techniques used in the engine that limit the
    variation in the programs that can be generated. Some of these can be
    accounted for by incorporating existing techniques, such as intelligent
    register allocation\cite{register-coloring}.

    Others require more specialized algorithms. This paper presents a novel
    approach to generating constants not found in the gadget library that
    achieves reasonable performance at the cost of variability. A more general
    approach would be desirable in a mature system.

    \subsection{Evaluator}

    Building a large library of gadgets that covers a wide range of operations
    is necessary to create complex programs. The current implementation handles
    only $19$ of the over $500$ unique \emph{x86} opcodes. It would be
    interesting to attempt to correlate the performance of the system to the
    number of supported opcodes.

    Similarly, in order to take full advantage of the supported opcodes, the
    evaluator would need to handle semantically equivalent buy syntacticly
    different expressions, e.g. $(1+1)*eax = (eax+eax)$.
