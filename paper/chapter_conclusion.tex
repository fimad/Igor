\chapter{Conclusion}
    
    This paper has presented a metamorphic system that is capable of producing
    programs that exhibit a high degree of variation in their byte-signatures
    while at the same time maintaining an opcode-frequency distribution similar
    to those found in benign Windows programs.

    This paper also provides empirical support for the claim made in
    \cite{franken} that statistical properties (such as distribution of bytes
    and opcodes) of a program composed of random blocks can be be determined by
    altering properties of the blocks.

    \section{Future Work}

    The system described is very much a proof of concept and as such there are
    many areas for improvement.

    It would be interesting to graph the relation between supported instructions
    in the abstract interpreter and the performance of the metamorphic engineh.
