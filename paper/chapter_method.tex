\chapter{Method}

    This section describes the theoretical underpinnings and the implementation
    of a gadget-based metamorphic engine. The engine works by maintaining a
    large library that maps from specific effects on execution state to bytes
    that will enact that transition when executed. Using this library and a
    semantic blueprint of a desired program, the engine generates an executable
    by nondeterministically piecing together bytes from the library in a way
    that fulfils the semantics of the program.

    \section{Gadgets}
    
    The idea of stitching together programs out of existing building blocks
    originated in the field of return-oriented programming \cite{rop_geo}.
    Return-oriented programming chains together small snippets of instructions
    ending in return statements through stack manipulations. Each of these
    snippets of instructions are called gadgets in the return-oriented
    programming community and each gadget typically performs a simple operation.

    The traditional formalization and use of gadgets has been heavily influenced
    by the constraints of return-oriented programming. Many of these imposed
    constraints are not present in the context of a metamorphic engine. For
    instance, the requirement that a gadget end in a return statement is
    necessary in return-oriented programming because that is the mechanism
    through which gadgets can be composed. However, the metamorphic engine is
    directly generating the text section of an executable this requirement is no
    longer necessary.

    Therefore, it is useful to re-formalize gadgets in the context where they
    are free of the constraints imposed by return-oriented programming. For the
    purposes of this engine, gadgets are defined by a pair of preconditions that
    described the execution state before performing the gadget, and a
    postconditions which describe the states after the gadget has been executed.

    To simplify the process of reasoning about a large collection of gadgets, a
    given bytestring is restricted to matching several of a collection of
    predefined gadget types. A Turing complete set of gadget types is given in
    \cite{franken}, and serves as the basis for the gadget types in this
    implementation. Each type of gadget is parameterized over a list of hardware
    locations\footnote{Memory addresses and registers}. A complete listing of
    gadgets and their definitions is given in table~\ref{tab:method-gadgets}.

    In table~\ref{tab:method-gadgets}, the set $C$ contains the set of hardware
    locations that the gadget overwrites in addition to performing it's intended
    semantics. Allowing gadgets to have limited side-effects describable by this
    ``clobber set'' allows for the inclusion of junk instructions in the
    bytestrings that map to any given gadget type. This is a desirable feature
    for a metamorphic engine because it leads to greater variety in the byte
    instances for each gadget type and through that more variety in the
    generated programs.

    \section{Semantic Blueprints}

    Gadgets as they are used in this engine occupy a similar position in the
    hierarchy of semantic complexity as assembly level instructions. They are
    parameterized over hardware locations, which would require a programmer
    writing a program in gadgets to manually maintain such things as the stack
    frame and the mapping of registers and memory locations to variables and
    function arguments.

    For this reason it would be convenient to be able to express program
    semantics using a higher level construct. The solution used in this
    implementation is ``abstract statements''. Abstract statements, or simply
    statements, exist at a similar level of complexity, but abstract away the
    hardware locations into variables. This divorces the program semantics from
    the specific hardware that it will be running on, and opens the door for
    cross-platform compilation.

    %TODO:Table of statements

    \section{Gadget Discovery}

    The code generation algorithm presupposes a large library that maps from
    gadget parameterizations to bytestrings that implement them.

    \subsection{Byte Source}

    Before we can begin matching bytestrings to gadgets and inserting them into
    the library we must first decide where the bytes are going to come from.
    The method proposed by \cite{franken} is to scan the host computer and pull
    bytes from found executables. This approach has the desirable property that
    the bytes are being sampled from benign programs. There is a fatal problem
    with this approach however, and that is approach is that it requires
    interaction with the host environment in a way that is easily recognizable
    by behavioural detection systems due to it's uncommonly large number of disk
    seeks.

    A naive alternative to this approach would be to randomly generate bytes
    from a uniform distribution. This solution has several beneficial
    properties, namely there is no longer any interaction with the host
    environment at all, there is no longer a limited number of bytes that can be
    sampled. Along with these potential niceties there is a significant downside
    as well. The distribution that the bytes are being sampled from no longer
    has any connection to the distribution of bytes found in benign programs.

    A natural alteration to the naive approach is to pre-calculate the
    distribution of bytes found in benign programs and randomly sample bytes
    from this calculated distribution. This approach maintains all of the
    desirable benefits of the naive approach while avoiding the shortcomings of
    both the naive approach and the approach proposed in \cite{franken}. In
    addition, there is also the additional benefit that since the distribution
    is calculated in advance, it is no longer tied to the host architecture,
    which opens the door for cross-platform code generation.

    \subsection{Symbolic Evaluation}

    In order to match a given bytestring with the various gadget types that it
    may implement, it is necessary to be able to represent the effect on
    hardware that the execution of the bytestring will have. Modelling the
    effect on hardware is done by disassembling the bytestring and then
    symbolically evaluating the instruction in sequence. The result is a series
    of state forests that represent the progressive effects on hardware.

    Each state forest contains a tree for each affected hardware location.  In
    turn, each tree in the forest is an expression tree where nodes are
    algebraic operations and leaves are the initial values of hardware
    locations.

    The types of algebraic operations that are allowed in the expression trees
    are limited to effects which are unconditional deterministic. Further each
    tree in the forest is required to correspond to a unique hardware location.
    %TODO:Why bother?

    %TODO:Give a diagram of what the state trees can look like
    
    \subsection{Gadget Matching}

    Each type of gadget recognized by the engine has a corresponding general
    state tree that describes it's core semantics. Examples of what these
    state trees look like are given in table~\ref{tab:method-general-trees}. The
    wild card nodes are constrained to only match leaf nodes which corresponds
    to the parameters of the gadget types described above.

    It would be theoretically possible to match gadgets on entire subtrees
    instead of just leaf nodes. This would allow for gadgets to be discovered
    that performed intricate compound operations, and possibly increase the
    variability of the programs the engine is capable of making. However this
    flexibility would come at a price, would be that the number of unique
    parameterizations of any given gadget type would be unbounded as each
    parameter could be any valid expression tree.

    %TODO:Give examples of what expressions trees look like

    Matching a bytestring and a corresponding sequence of instructions to
    gadgets types is done by attempting to match each node of the gadget's
    general tree with any tree in the bytestring's state forest. The hardware
    locations that correspond to the unmatched trees in the state forest make up
    the clobber set of the matched gadget.

    In order to ensure that the clobber set is able to entirely account for all
    of the side effects of executing the bytestring there are restrictions that
    are placed on the unmatched expression trees in order for the match to be
    accepted. Namely, that the expression trees must be ``safe'' to execute
    regardless of the current execution state. To achieve this the unmatched
    trees are only allowed to correspond to writes to registers, and are not
    allowed to include any memory accesses as it is not possible to guarantee
    which locations in memory will be in the resulting program's address space.

    \section{Code Generation}

    Generating executables from a semantic blueprint is done by taking a
    representation of a program as a sequence of statements and first resolving
    the statements into gadgets and then resolving each gadget into actual
    bytes.

    In order to translate statements into gadgets it is necessary to first
    assign variables to hardware locations. This requires keeping track of which
    registers and memory locations are free and which have already been assigned
    to variables. This paper uses a naive approach that assigns all local
    variables and method arguments as memory addresses offset from the EBP
    register. A fully mature implementation of this engine would use a more
    efficient scheme and there is a lot of literature in compilers to be drawn
    on \cite{COMPILER-REGISTER-MAPPING}, however for the purposes of
    demonstration the naive approach is adequate.

    %TODO:^^^FIND SOURCES TO CITE FOR REGISTER MAPPING

    Once a mapping of local variables to hardware locations has been determined
    it and statements have been translated to gadgets generating the bytecode
    code for each method can be done by sequentially retrieving bytestrings
    from the gadget library for each gadget. 

    \subsection{Variable Mapping \& Statement to Gadget Translation}

    Because gadgets can only be parameterized over hardware locations and not
    local variables, a variable mapping must be generated before statements can
    be translated into gadgets. It is possible once an assignment exists to
    directly compile statements into gadgets. However while this approach may
    theoretically work, in practice this is highly inefficient.
    
    %TODO: Give example

    Recall that in this implementation, gadgets correspond to short sequences of
    $x86$ instructions typically on the order of 1-4 instructions long. Most
    $x86$ instructions only operate on registers. If we were to naively
    translate statements into a single gadget, the gadget would have to include
    the instructions that load values from memory into registers and then if
    applicable store the value back in memory. The odds of a random sequence of
    instructions that cooperate in this manner appearing randomly is very
    small. Therefore to make search a practical method of code generation, it is
    necessary to prune search paths that are unlikely to be fruitful.

    To increase the likelihood that any given gadget will be present in the
    library, statement translation explicitly generates gadgets that load
    variables from memory addresses into temporary registers. An example of a
    possible translation is given below. Note that each gadget is tagged with
    the bound registers. This information will be required later when
    translating gadgets to bytes to ensure that no temporary registers are
    overridden as a side effect of the gadget.

    %TODO: example of explicit loads and stores

    \subsection{Gadget to Byte Translation}

    Translating bytes to gadgets is relatively straight forward in most cases
    and can be accomplished by randomly selecting a bytestring from the gadget
    library for any given gadget.

    The primary constraint is ensuring that the chosen bytestring does not have
    any unintended side effects. Recall that effects on hardware that are
    outside the scope of the core semantic of a given gadget are allowed and
    that such effects are encapsulated in the ``clobber set''. The clobber set
    contains a set of hardware locations that will be in an undefined state
    after execution of the gadget.

    Therefore to ensure that a gadget does not have unintended effects on the
    execution state it is sufficient to require that the gadget's clobber set be
    a subset of the unallocated registers. It is only necessary to consider
    registers because in the creation of the gadget library memory writes were
    disallowed from being present in the clobber set.

    In the case that there are no bytestrings available for a given gadget, the
    algorithm backtracks and tries another translation of the current statement
    using different temporary registers. If every combination of temporary
    registers is tried unsuccessfully the algorithm continues backtracking all
    the way to the top of the search tree to where variables are mapped. If
    backtracking this far is still insufficient the engine terminates with the
    conclusion that the gadget library is too small does not provided adequate
    coverage. 

    \subsection{Edge Cases}

    The above works well for most types of gadgets but there are several
    edge cases that require further optimizations to make the engine practical.
    The first is the assignment of constants to variables and the second is
    forward jumps.

    \subsubsection{Constants}

    The naive approach to gadget assignment would be to directly translate an
    assignment statement into a corresponding \emph{LoadConst} gadget. However,
    for such a gadget to be found during the construction of the library it is
    necessary that a particular 32 bit value be present in the bytestring at the
    correct offset. This is a both very likely and would also be impractical to
    store each $2^{32}$ possible \emph{loadConst} gadget in the library. 

    A logical solution would be to attempt to construct the equivalent of an
    \emph{LoadConst} gadget out of gadgets that exist in the library. There are
    some caveats with this approach, namely that it is reminiscent of the subset
    sum problem\footnote{The subset problem aims to find a subset of a set of
    integer whose sum is equal to a target integer} which is NP-complete.

    The following is a novel solution whose runtime is independent of the number
    of bits in the constant being loaded. Loading an $n$-bit constant is done
    using two gadgets. The first loads a constant where the most significant
    bits match the lower $n$ bits of the desired constant. The second gadget
    performs an arithmetic right shift of $32-n$ on this value to generate the
    desired constant.

    The $x86$ shift instruction takes as an operand a $8$ bit number for the
    shift amount. This improves the odds of successfully compiling an assignment
    statement to bytes because it relies on the odds of an $8$ bit and an $n$
    bit number being generated independently rather than a specific $32$ bit
    integer.

    \subsubsection{Jumping Forward}

    The second edge case that requires special handling is forward jumps. The
    problem arises because jump statements are written with relative offsets in
    terms of statements while gadgets have offsets expressed in bytes. This
    means that in order to resolve jump statements to gadgets it is necessary to
    know the byte offset of the statement that the jump is trying to jump to.

    This becomes a problem when dealing with code that attempts to jump forward,
    for example see the example code in figure~\ref{fig:method-forward-jump}.
    In order to know the byte offset of the target statement, the current
    statement must be compiled first which results in a circular dependency.

    %TODO: Forward jump figure

    The proposed method of resolving the circular dependency is to perform
    compilation in two phase. During the first phases non-jump statements are
    translated into bytes as described above. However, when a jump gadget is
    encountered, the size of its corresponding bytestring is guessed and a
    placeholder of the appropriate size that notes the target offset is
    generated. After which, following statements are compiled as above.

    After each statement has been translated into bytes and place holders, the
    second phase translates the place holders into appropriate bytestrings. If
    there are no corresponding bytes for the gadget in the library, then the
    search backtracks potentially up to the translation of the problematic jump
    statement in the first phase and where a different size would be guessed.
    The backtracking process also considers different statement to gadget and
    gadget to byte translations on the way back to re-translating the problematic
    jump. This allows for the potential for the target byte offset to change
    without having to throw away all of the translations after the problematic
    jump.

    \section{Scaffolding}

    The code generation algorithm given above handles turning statements into
    bytes, but it does not handle linking or any of the other requirements of
    generating actual executables.

    As this is a proof of concept system and not intended for production use,
    this implementation uses the following handwritten assembly code and tools
    from the GNU Compiler Collection to create object files for each method, and
    link them to form actual executables.

    This approach is ideal as it allows for easy inspection of the generated
    code in the object files, along with providing a mechanism for linking
    generated methods against c code to perform unit testing to ensure the
    correctness of the engine.
